Notes regarding file format: 
-() indicate where input values should go. Format and desired values are described by the description inside the parenthesis. () must be removed once an input is given.
  -Example: "(Semester Year)" would become "Spring 2021"
-Every course will have the following format (Department CourseNumber CourseName)
-If there is no range of electives to specify from, set range to ""
-If there are no substitutions of electives, set substitutions to []. Same applies for additionalCoreCourseRequirements
